  Technical note: the sonograms are made in Amadeus, at 22050hz, using a FFT size of 16384, 256 pixels high, with a Welch 'window'. Logarithmic frequencies of 2.0 points per half-tone, logarithmic amplitudes at 80 db with a high-frequency emphasis of 1.3/Khz. The palette is one I made, called 'Heat', which goes from black to red over the first half of it, then to orange, yellow, white, and finally blue-white.
