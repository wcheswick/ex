This is my shot at a set of hands-on science museum exhibit software.
Some of these have actually run in read science or children museums.

lcs runs at the Liberty Science Center across the river from New York
City.  The original version of this was a Photoshop-style photo
munger, installed before Photoshop existed.  It ran for about twenty
years, a very popular exhibit.  

During a renovation they asked for an improvement, and I changed
the lsc exhibit to run on live video.  That version is in here.

Chat ran at the Chattannooga Children's Discovery Museum, a simplified
version of lsc that tries to emulate the style of famous artists with
algorithms. 

All of these worked when last tested, but there may be bitrot here.

The code last compiled on a FreeBSD machine, with a number of ports
installed.  Check out the Makefile for clues to building the ports and
software. When last tried, all these routines compiled completely and
cleanly, but port interfaces and compiler options change.
