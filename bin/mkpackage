Several open source hands-on science museum exhibits.  These are designed
roughly ten-year olds, but I hope are fun for all ages.  Many of the exhibits
require extra hardware, such as a video source and a cheap Hauppauge video
card, or perhaps a microphone and working audio. This software runs in VESA
display mode, which requires a small kernel mod to FreeBSD (included).

Live CD versions can be created, so they
can be run on machines without touching the hard drives.
