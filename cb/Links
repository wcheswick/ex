ABOUT VISCHECK

Vischeck draws on algorithms developed at many different vision 
laboratories around the world. In particular, this plug-in owes a 
great deal to a 1997 paper by Brettel, Vienot and Mollon entitled 
"Computerized simulation of color appearance for dichromats" 
(Journal of the Optical Society of America v14 pp2647) and
to recent work from Brian Wandell's group at Stanford
(http://white.stanford.edu).
