Subject: Digital darkroom exhibit

Greetings!

It has been many years since I last worked on the Digital Darkroom
interactive video display many years ago.  

You ran it for quite a while, occasionally making plaintive requests
for support of new hardware, etc.  Alas, I was busy elsewhere.

But now I am freshening up all my exhibits, including yours.  I suspect
the old one is long gone, but if you want updated software, I can
give it to you easily.

The new version has the following changes from the ancient one you ran:
- it now does the artistic transforms on live images.  Imaging having
        a live oil painting
- it now assumes that the display is the modern 16x9 screen, which I drive
        at 1680x1050
- the software should be able to run on almost any PC-style hardware.  Really
        old systems might be very slow.  I am using a first-generation 
        Mac mini, and it works great
- the software is available on a live-CD, i.e. you insert the CD, boot, and
        some while later the exhibit is running.  The local hard drive is
        not used, and you can try it out on various machines, like the office
        PCs, without interfering with the machine.
- it uses any modern web cam.  I am using the Logitech 910, an HD webcam
        available from Amazon for well under $100.
- it is designed for a touch screen, and I finally have one to play with (after
        20 years!) You can use the mouse, or touch screen.

As always, this is available without charge, and I invite suggestions to
improve the exhibit software.

If you are (still) interested, I'd love to hear from you.
