monochromasy - complete absence of any color sensation

People with normal cones and light sensitive pigment (trichromasy)

A mild color deficiency is present when one or more of the three cones light sensitive pigments are not quite right and their peak sensitivity is  shifted (anomalous trichromasy -  includes protanomaly and deuteranomaly).  A more severe color deficiency is present when one or more of the cones light sensitive pigments is really wrong (dichromasy - includes protanopia and deuteranopia). 

protans (red weak) and deutans (green weak) because they make up 99% of this group.

Deuteranomaly (five out of 100 males): 
The deuteranomalous person is considered "green weak".
