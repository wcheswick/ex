From the license
    http://colorlab.wickline.org/docs/legal.html#license
  
to the documentation table of contents (link at top of page)
    http://colorlab.wickline.org/docs/
  
scroll to the very bottom and find the link for "source"
    http://colorlab.wickline.org/colorlab.tar.gz
  
which lets you run the colorlab locally. In there you'll find the 
engine.js file which is also the same as you'd find at
  
    http://colorlab.wickline.org/engine.js
  
In skimming this source I see that among issues I'd remembered,
there is the sad fact that the comments are in places a bit out of
sync with the state of the script. In particular there's some
comments toward the end about how I'll maybe one day calculate
colorblind simulations of colors rather than looking them up in a
table. The code currently does that calculation. It used to just
have a lookup table for the "web safe" colors.
  
For some reason when I saw your initial email, I thought you were
talking about the colorlab
    http://colorlab.wickline.org/
rather than the colorfilter
    http://colorfilter.wickline.org/
This is probably because the colorfilter doesn't talk about source
code availability while the colorlab does.

For the applications you have in mind, I think that the colorlab
javascript source code will be a good enough starting point. The
colorfilter does the same transformations, but with perl code and
has way more ancillary code for the processing of HTML/CSS/images
that would just get in your way.

The code you want is located below

    function update_colorpicker_image()

and above

    function lookup_data( r,g,b )

and in particular, the meat of the matter is in

    function color_blind_sims( r,g,b )

The rest of code between the indicated landmarks is just the data
and support for translating between color spaces and some
colorblindness-describing metrics in the Yuv color space.

Enjoy :)
