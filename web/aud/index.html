<h2>What does sound look like?<.h2>

The volume and audio spectrum of sound sources are displayed in
real time.  Sound can come from the microphone, or selected from a number
of recordings.  It's fun to see kids making rude noises at the machine.
<p> 

The user interface is designed for a touch screen, but any mouse
or track ball
should work fine.  It needs a monaural microphone and speaker.
The keyboard is only used for certain administrative
and test commands, and should not be reachable by the public.

<h2>Status - 8 Aug. 2004</h2>

Works pretty well, though the FFT code is not quite right.  It only
works for microphone input at the moment:  the program does not yet know
how to read .wav files, nor turn the speakers on to play sounds from
files.  Over 60 minutes of interesting sounds have been collected so far.
It would be nice to have some public domain music, especially a soprano
singing opera:  the vibrato is very cool.
<P>

Needs an attract loop, which is likely to drive the museum docents crazy
over the long run.
