<h1>Science Museum Exhibits - Creating a Nobel Prizewinner</h1>

Most scientists and engineers get their interest in technical topics at
an early age.  In my case, it was about 4th grade (9 years old.)  An excitement
for science at this early age provides the motivation for all the subsequent
hard work needed to learn about our universe and our technologies.
<p>

Unfortunately, the American public school system is notably weak on science
teaching in the early grades.  Good science teachers are in short supply in
all grades, but especially for the students at this formative stage.  These
kids often must become autodidacts:  they often have to investigate this cool
stuff for themselves, perhaps in spite of their school work.  (I remember being
very proud that my sixth grade report card said that I probably knew more science
than the science teacher.  I am not proud any more, I am disgusted.  I was attending
one of the highest-rated public school systems in the nation.)
<p>

So I've decided to extend my original science museum exhibit software, and give the
results away in the hopes that it will help kids (and their beleaguered science teachers)
explore some aspects of science and math further.  A good science museum exhibit will
teach and entertain if used for only a couple of minutes, when there is a line waiting
to use the exhibit.  Ideally, what is going on at the exhibit should be visible to the rest,
so they can get the hang of it while they are waiting.
<p>

But the best exhibits are those with depth, those that can keep interest for half an
hour or more on a quite day.  I hope that most of these meet that goal, and that they
will be used at home or in quiet moments in school PC labs.
<p>

It takes a lot of people to make a Nobel prizewinner, and I have no illusions that I will
actually meet one who was stimulated by these exhibits.  But you never know.
<p>

I welcome assistance and ideas for
new exhibits.

<h2>Exhibits</h2>

The following exhibits have working prototypes:

<menu>
<li><a href="chat/index.html"><b>Portrait Style Station</b></a> for Chattanooga's
	<a href="http://www.cdmfun.org/">Creative Discovery Museum</a>.
	The video images are snapped, then several transforms are available
	in the style of various artists.  Some would say that this trivializes
	art.  I think it expands a kid's artistic vocabulary.
	The new software performs these transforms on live images, at roughly
	30 frames per second.
<li><a href="lsc/index.html"><b>Digital Darkroom</b></a> for the
	<a href="http://www.lsc.org">Liberty Science Center</a>.
	Makes a series of real-time, Photoshop-like transforms on live images.
	Obviously,
	it will slow down a bit if there are a lot of expensive transforms.
<li><a href="aud/index.html"><b>What does sound look like?</b></a>
	I started writing an audio version of the Digital Darkroom, and found
	that the audio spectrum of ambient sounds was so interesting that
	I have made it into
	an exhibit itself.  I have been recording sounds from around the world
	to supplement the microphone input. 
<li><a href="lot/index.html"><b>How Long Does it Take to Win the Lottery?</b></a>
	A popular six-number lottery is simulated.  You pick the numbers,
	and play twice a week until you get all six numbers right.  This program
	has to deal with the Y100K problem!

<h2>Exhibit Ideas</h2>

<h2>Further information</h2>

<menu>
<li><a href="tech.html"><b>Technical Overview and Hardware</b></a>
<li><a href="source.html"><b>Latest source code</b></a>
<li><b>ISO boot file</b> is not available yet.  I have to figure out how to
	generate it.

<h2>History</h2>

In the early 1990s The Liberty Science Center, then under construction, came to
Bell Labs and asked <href="http://eis.jpl.nasa.gov/~gh/">Gerard Holtzman</a>
to implement his Digital Darkroom work as an interactive science exhibit.
Gerard came to me, and we developed the
<a href="../digitaldarkroom.html">Digital Darkroom</a>.
<p>

Now it is now more than a decade later, CPUS are 100 times faster,
the Liberty Science
Center is about to launch a 22 month remodeling effort, and the folks in
Chattanooga are having trouble finding replacement Targa boards for their version,
the Portrait Style Station.
<p>

So I am updating the software, and designing new exhibits.  The software
will be available without charge to the public.  I hope it will be used
in science museums, schools, and perhaps doctors' waiting rooms.
