<h2>How Long Does it Take to Win the Lottery?<.h2>

The user selects six numbers out of 49, or lets the computer select
the numbers.  Then two lottery drawings per week are simulated
until the chosen numbers are matched.  The program keeps a running
tabulation of the money spent on lottery tickets, and the money
won from matching three, four, five, and all six numbers.
The rules and pay outs are from an actual state lottery.
<p> 

The user interface is designed for a touch screen, but any mouse
or track ball
should work fine.  The keyboard is only used for certain administrative
and test commands, and should not be reachable by the public.

Works great.  The subtitle needs some text-rendering work.
Needs an attract loop.
